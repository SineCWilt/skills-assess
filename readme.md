# JLB Skills Assessment â€“ Frontend Layout

## Overview

This project was completed as part of a skills assessment for JLB. The primary goal was to demonstrate proficiency in modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building a responsive, accessible, and visually appealing web layout.

Key features include:
- A dynamic hero section that randomly selects a background image on page load.
- A YouTube video embedded directly into the layout with responsive scaling.
- A multi-column content section showcasing layout and typography control.
- Adaptive design techniques to ensure usability across screen sizes, including 1920px and mobile breakpoints.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3** (including media queries and flexbox)
- **JavaScript** (vanilla, no libraries)
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control
- **Visual Studio Code** for development

## Features

### ðŸ”€ Dynamic Hero Image
Each time the page loads, a new image is randomly selected for the hero background using JavaScript.

### ðŸ“º Embedded Video
A YouTube iframe is styled and positioned responsively within the layout to scale appropriately across breakpoints.

### ðŸ§± Responsive Content Layout
The main content area uses `flexbox` for layout and `media queries` to ensure the design adjusts cleanly for desktop and tablet breakpoints.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Considerations
- Maintains brand styling with strong use of color and spacing
- Typography scales across viewports
- Focused on accessibility with semantic HTML structure
